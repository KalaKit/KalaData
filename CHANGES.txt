> 0.1
- added CLI
- added command system
- added compression and decompression with LZSS and Huffman algorithm

> 0.2
general improvements:
	
	- archive header and per-file metadata layout revision for better memory/byte alignment
	- can compress/decompress single file
	- AES-GCM encryption/decryption

speed improvements:
	
	- faster match finder (hash-chain or binary-tree match finder)
	- per-file multithreading
	- chunk-based parallelism (split single large files into chunks and compress in parallel, one thread per chunk)
	- rolling hash in match finder (skip non-matching regions faster than byte-by-byte compare)  
	- SIMD/vectorized copies and match scans (use SSE/AVX/NEON to accelerate memory-heavy operations)  
	- buffered I/O with large block sizes or memory-mapped files (reduce system call overhead during read/write)
	- store code lengths (canonical form) and build a fixed-width or 2-level table for O(1) byte decode

UPCOMING CHANGES
==========================================================

Format efficiency:
- pack 8 flags per token into one byte (bitmask) and interleave the payloads
- skip Huffman for very small files (avoid overhead on tiny inputs)
- precomputed “fixed” Huffman tables for common symbol distributions (e.g. ASCII text, zero-heavy data)
- adaptive strategy: switch between raw/LZSS/Huffman depending on file type or size thresholds

Compression ratio improvements:
- peek one byte ahead (lazy matching heuristic to improve match selection)
- improve parser beyond greedy/lazy (multi-step lookahead or optimal parsing for better ratio)
