UPCOMING CHANGES
==========================================================

- per-file multithreading
- faster match finder (hash-chain or binary-tree match finder)
- peek one byte ahead: if taking a 1-byte literal now leads to a longer match next step, choose the literal
- store code lengths (canonical form) and build a fixed-width or 2-level table for O(1) byte decode
- pack 8 flags per token into one byte (bitmask) and then interleave the payloads
